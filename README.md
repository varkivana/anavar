I want to tell you a little about my town. I’m sure that you’ll like it and maybe you will even have a wish to visit it. Believe me, your visit won’t be in vain. 
In my town you will find a great number of various parks and sideshows, clubs and restaurants, movies and theaters and many other interesting sites.
I have been living in … for 10 years. 
I moved here after graduation from university, got fixed up in a job and met my better half. As you see, many things connect me with this town.
I live not far from the center. It will take me only 10 minutes by car to get to the central part of the town. If I take a bus, the road trip will take 20 minutes or longer.
And this happens mainly because of the regular bus stops. I’m not very demanding of choosing a means of transportation, 
but I can say for sure that at times going by public transportation is even more fascinating. One may look through the window, enjoy greenery and nature, watch passengers and delight in wonderful weather.
My town has everything you may dream of, though cultural establishments and events prevail.
Libraries, gyms and sports grounds, gardens, swimming pools, courts and hobby-clubs – this is what makes happy both kids and adults. We also adore fairs and festivals which often take place in our town.
